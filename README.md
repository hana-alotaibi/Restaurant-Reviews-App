Project title:
Restaurant-Reviews-App.

Description:
In this project, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

Instalation:
Colen the hana-alotaibi and use Restaurant-Reviews-App to install, then follow the instructions below:

In the repository folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal (like Git Bash, Cygwin or the Windows terminal), check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000 or python -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000. You can now see the live site.
